Today the outcome of the entrance test for Institute for Genetics and Development Biology is sent to me by email with the deadline at 08-02 to determine student type. 
In order to reduce the casualty of my decision, I accepted to study as an academic master student in the first place. 
After some of their teachers contacting me via emails, phone calls and messages, I fell exhausted by choosing between Tsinghua and IGDB. 
In the end, considering the reputation, school environment, self interest and teachers, and further development, I choose Tsinghua University after chatting with my parents at night.

More to write on tomorrow, it's  too late now, good night.

In the morning I try to use gitbook to create an online book. 
There was something wrong when I tried to sign in gitbook.com. 
But when I switch to Google Chrome from Microsoft Edge, it works well. 
In the end, I put some of my reading notes on it. 
More I wish will appear on this gitbook in the future.
