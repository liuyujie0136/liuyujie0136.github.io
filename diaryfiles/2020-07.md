In the morning I try to use gitbook to create an online book. 
There was something wrong when I tried to sign in gitbook.com. 
But when I switch to Google Chrome from Microsoft Edge, it works well. 
In the end, I put some of my reading notes on it. 
More I wish will appear on this gitbook in the future.
