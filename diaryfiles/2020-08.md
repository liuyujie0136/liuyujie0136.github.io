In the morning I reviewed some part of physiology, and I stopped doing so at 3 p.m. because sufficient light is not available from my bedroom window. Then I used computer to watch some videos and continue with document writing which started yesterday.

When I wanted to review physiology in the morning, I found my desktop lamp was broken. With the noise arising from the renovation by under stairs neighbour, it was difficult to concentrate on the textbook in such a dim and noisy environment!

I cooked three dishes, namely洋葱炒鸡蛋, 芦笋炒肉丝, 包菜肉丝汤, for dinner. All of them taste good.
In the evening we bought a new LED lamp online for future use. Then I began to do some ‘copy-and-paste’ work about the discussion part of previous course on the book ‘The Path of Beauty (美的历程)’. I have finished most of them.

At about 11:30 a.m., the application for returning to school was approved!

In the evening I had a phone call with R. We talked about some books and things about returning to school scheduled at 10th August and the life in low-humidity-and- heating-supplying city Beijing.
